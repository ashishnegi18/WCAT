# WCAT
Project Title : WCAT Tool using Javascript
Author: Ashish Negi

Hey there! Thanks for viewing my WCAT Tool. Before Proceeding, install node before trying to run it if you haven't already.

Overview:
The cat (short for “concatenate“) command is one of the most frequently used commands in Linux/Unix-like operating systems. cat command allows us to create single or multiple files, view content of a file, concatenate files and redirect output in terminal or files.
In this Program, we are going to make a clone tool similar to cat which we have named as "wcat" and will develop few handy wcat commands.

In order to give this custom Tool a feel of an original one we've created a custom script that enabled us to use wcat in place of npm run wcat while doing/performing something with our CLI.

Tools used :
Language: Javascript
IDE: Visual Studio Code
